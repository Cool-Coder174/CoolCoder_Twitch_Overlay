# **App Name**: StreamGlass Terminal

## Core Features:

- Terminal Content Renderer: Displays the predefined 'Starting Soon' message and dynamic stream-related text within a central retro-styled terminal window.
- Configurable Color Theme: Allows selection between a 'neon green' or 'amber' monochrome color palette, applying the chosen theme to text and UI glows.
- Retro Text Animations: Implements classic typewriter effect for text appearance, a blinking block cursor, and subtle phosphor glow/decay effects for authentic retro feel.
- Floating Glass UI: Renders the main terminal with a sleek, translucent 'glassy' aesthetic, featuring softly rounded 80s-Mac corners, a glowing border, and gentle parallax motion.
- Dynamic Background Animator: Generates a dark, slightly noisy background with slowly animating, faint gridlines or wireframe patterns, enhancing the floating terminal effect.
- Ambient Visual FX Engine: Adds subtle CRT scanline overlays, occasional screen flicker, and a reflective glass sheen across the terminal window for enhanced realism.
- Looped Idle Animation Tool: Generates a variety of abstract visual indicators, waveform lines, or retro system activity light patterns in a seamless loop to imply an active, waiting system. The LLM uses a tool to select good animations.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary Color: Deep purple (#4B0082) to establish a sophisticated and modern base.
- Secondary Color: Vibrant yellow (#FFDA63) to provide contrast and highlight key elements.
- Accent Color: Electric blue (#000ff3) to add a jolt of energy and futuristic flair.
- Terminal Text Color: A matrix-inspired green (#00FF00) mimicking a vim terminal, creating a hacker aesthetic.
- Main Content Font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace sans-serif) emulates the pixelated aesthetic of a bitmap terminal font.
- Minimalist, block-style geometric indicators and a precise blinking block cursor reinforce the retro terminal visual language.
- Centered, rectangular terminal window with rounded corners inspired by early 80s Macintosh displays, encompassed by a delicate, luminous thin border.
- Synchronized animations including typewriter text effect, blinking cursor, CRT scanlines, screen flicker, phosphor decay, and parallax/floating motion for the terminal window, and slowly animating background grids/wireframes, all looping seamlessly.
